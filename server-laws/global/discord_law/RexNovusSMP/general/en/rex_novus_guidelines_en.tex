	\item You must also contact the person responsible (\ref{members}) if anything is unclear.
	\item If one of the provisions violates the constitution of the country of a person concerned, only the unlawful passage is cancelled for that person.

Sending five or more messages in a short period of time can have consequences. $^{3}$The unauthorised use of pings is also prohibited due to its provocative nature.
	\item $^{1}$Racist, political and ethically unacceptable content (statements, images, etc.) is prohibited and will result in permanent exclusion from the entire Discord server. $^{2}$This also applies to pornographic content. $^{3}$This also applies to the deliberate arrangement of reactions of the category `Regional Indicator' to such statements. \footnote{Message Reaction Act of 19 July 2023} $^{4}$The sending of GIFs is prohibited.\footnote{Channel Usage Act of 12 February 2023} $^{5}$ Symbols and trivialisation of \textbf{any} politically extremist acts or groups are prohibited.\footnote{This also applies to left-wing extremist groups; Anti-Extremism Act of 20 February 2024}

		  $^{2}$ You must also adhere to the description of the channels and the correct use of their functions.\footnote{Channel Usage Act Amendment of 15 March 2024}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Team members}\label{members}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Instructions from authorised team members are binding and must always be followed.
	\item Team members are identified by a rank or role.
	\item The authorised team members include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The CEO
		\item The CLO
		\item The CSO\footnote{Domain Security Act of 29 March 2024}
		\item The CTO
		\item The investors
		\item The COO
		\item The CAO
		\item The Technicians
		\item The DC moderators
		\item The MC moderators

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Behaviour in voice channels}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Apart from the regulations from \ref{verhalten}, the following additional provisions apply to voice channels.
	\item The use of voice distorters and soundboards is permitted, provided the team members do not object.
	\item It is not permitted to record persons without their consent.
	\item Misbehaviour in voice channels justifies a temporary server-wide mute.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Secondary accounts}
Secondary accounts must be marked as such. To do this, you must edit your server profile in such a way that it is possible for anyone to see whose secondary account it is based on this profile.

\subsection{Penalty}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item A distinction is generally made between three penalties:
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item A warning is a preliminary stage to actual punitive measures. Every member receives a warning for less serious offences.
		\item A timeout refers to a temporary exclusion from the server.
		\item A permanent ban is an irrevocable, indefinite exclusion from the server.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The penalty is rarely assessed according to the severity of the offence, but usually according to the following guideline:
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item First warning
		\item Second warning
		\item 24-hour timeout
		\item One-week timeout
		\item One-month timeout
		\item One-year timeout
		\item Permanent ban
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Every sentence must be revoked without exception if the person punished can prove that the sentence was unlawful.
	\item Unlawfulness exists if the offence in question is not a violation on the part of the person punished, if the punishment violates paragraphs 1 and 2 or if the offence was wrongly classified as an offence of particular gravity.
	\item If the offence is a serious one, an immediate timeout or even an immediate permanent ban may be imposed, depending on the severity of the offence. The assessment of the severity is subject to the person responsible, but must be comprehensible. 
	\item In case of doubt, the judgement may be overturned and reversed or converted into another penalty by the CLO or by a qualified majority of the Board of Directors.
	\item Any unlawful messages must be permanently stored in the criminal record in the form of a screenshot together with the description of the incident\footnote{Permanence and entries in the criminal record since the Criminal Records Act of 15 March 2024}, so that in case of doubt the unlawfulness can be challenged\footnote{This is due to past difficulties in assessing the unlawfulness of statements in retrospect}, after which an application for deletion can be made to the Board, which must be confirmed by a qualified majority.
	\item After each timeout, the severity of the offence increases in such a way that the first offence after a timeout is increased in accordance with the penalty hierarchy from paragraph 2 numbers 1 - 7 due to its severity in relation to the previous basic penalty\footnote{The first penalty after a timeout, or the first penalty in total}.
	\item Permanent bans are partially excluded from paragraph 8. These should only be imposed in cases of extreme severity or if paragraph 8 applies, provided there is no acute improvement in behaviour and the Executive Board votes in favour in a simple majority resolution.
	\item It is not permitted to unban people from the server without the express permission of the CLO. This is considered a criminal offence and will be punished with a timeout regardless of the position in the penalty hierarchy according to the interpretation in paragraph 8. The illegally unbanned person must also be banned immediately.
	\item $^{1}$Violations of particular severity by members of a company division will result in permanent exclusion from this and other company divisions. $^{2}$This regulation does not apply to the.god.emperor or ryurai\_jokhin\_pc or their secondary accounts.
	\item Complicity, aiding and abetting, incitement and attempt are penalised equivalently.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Owner}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item The term `owner' corresponds to the term `shareholder' in accordance with ยง3 para. 1 OwnP.
	\item Any resolutions of the owners require a qualified majority, unless the provisions of the ownership provisions contradict this.
	\item An admin council can be convened by order of the owners, at which the admins and moderators who are not shareholders each receive one vote and take the decision for the shareholders' meeting.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Chairmanship}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item The Chief Executive Officer is the Chairman of the Executive Board in accordance with ยง8 para. 2 OwnP. This rank is abbreviated to `CEO'.

	\item The founders are the.god.emperor and ryurai\_jokhin\_pc (705020938810294392, 744269509770346626).
	\item Should both founders resign from the Executive Board, a new Chairman of the Executive Board must be elected by the Executive Board by a simple minority vote.

	\item The Legal Division is able to determine the interpretation of individual laws by means of judgements, provided that this is within a comprehensible framework.\footnote{Prejudice Act of 17 March 2024}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Moderation}\label{support}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Any questions regarding the Discord and Minecraft server that do not fall within the legal area are the responsibility of the moderation team. If there are any uncertainties regarding the area of responsibility, you should also contact the moderation department.
	\item The moderation department is responsible for monitoring compliance with the server guidelines.
	\item This means that they are able to enforce penalties without authorisation, but these must be forwarded to the legal department together with the context and finally confirmed.

	\item It is chaired by the Chief Security Officer (CSO).
	\item The processes within this department are subject to the strictest secrecy and may only be published with the permission of the CEOs.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Minecraft server}
\subsection{Basic rules}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Minecraft server law is subject to Discord server law.
	\item It is forbidden to use methods that give an advantage to other players, regardless of whether they use the method or not, that are not generally recognised as fair.
	\item Any behaviour not affected by such methods is not punishable.
	\item Paragraph 3 excludes the construction of structures intended to reduce server performance.
	\item On the Minecraft server, you must behave in accordance with the respective rules of the Discord server.
	\item The general server law does not differentiate between factions, which is why they are merely an internal organisation that is not covered by any server-wide laws and therefore crimes against them cannot be the subject of server-wide judgements.
	\item Paragraph 3 only applies if the offences are not directed against the rules of the Discord server or Paragraph 1f.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Guarantee}\footnote{Guarantee Act of 30 June 2023}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Only persons for whom someone can be proven to be a guarantor may be placed on the whitelist.
	\item If a person commits an offence of particular gravity, the existing guarantee relationships will be reviewed and may be terminated if necessary\footnote{para. 2 - 3: Guarantee Act Amendment of 20 February 2024}.
	\item If a guarantor is banned from the server, all guarantee relationships with this guarantor are terminated.
	\item Guarantees cannot be withdrawn retrospectively.
	\item The administration is exempt from para. 2 - 4.
	\item $^{1}$ You must submit an application for inclusion on the whitelist.$^{2}$ This must be done via the support channel.$^{3}$ Applications submitted otherwise are invalid without exception.\footnote{Guarantee Act Amendment II of 06 May 2024}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Legal separation}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item The server right must be clearly distinguished from the internal legal situation on the branches of the Rex Novus SMP.
	\item Internal law refers to constitutions and rules that are not recognised by the owners in their function as a shareholders' meeting, such as the group's own legal texts.
	\item The inspection and use of server data and other information that is only accessible to the administration, such as player data or logs, may not be used as evidence for trials and the like that are not carried out by the Supreme Server Court in its function\footnote{for example, in-game murders may not be proven via logs}.
	\item This does not apply in the area around the world entry point, including the world entry point itself. This is domain-governed territory, so domain jurisdiction applies accordingly.\footnote{Spawn Protection Act of 16 May 2024}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Server-wide Arrest Warrants and Detention Orders}\footnote{Law Enforcement Act dated May 27, 2024}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item If a person has committed crimes against the written constitution of a nation or a union of states, they may apply for an arrest warrant with the server's legal department.
    \item The legal department must then issue an order for the person to appear before the competent court, which the person must comply with.
    \item During the trial, a member of the legal department not involved in the trial must attend as an observer.
    \item If the server attorney deems an arrest warrant based on the trial to be sufficiently justified, it must be verified where the person was located at the time the arrest warrant was requested.
	\item $^{1}$If the person was in domestic territory or the external world at that time, the process can proceed without hindrance. $^{2}$If the person was in a foreign country occupied by a server member, the state where the person was located must consent to the extradition. $^{3}$If the person was on other territory, it is to be decided by random procedure whether the nation consents to the extradition.
	\item If the person was in domestic territory, the outside world or if extradition was authorised, a random decision is made as to whether the arrest was successful.
	\item If extradition was not authorised, the arrest warrant is pending until extradition is authorised. This only has effect if the person in question is in the respective country. Otherwise, authorisation must be obtained from the new country of residence. If the arrest was unsuccessful, the arrest warrant loses its effect.
	\item If the arrest was unsuccessful, a detention order is issued. This is a request under server law to submit to punishment.
	\item If a person does not comply with the request, this has consequences under server law and the arrest is enforced by means of operator orders.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Escape from Server-Legally Imposed Detention Order}\footnote{Law Enforcement Act dated May 27, 2024}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item If a person has complied with the detention directive, after having served at least half an hour and at most half of the sentence, they may apply for an escape to the legal department of the server.
	\item The legal department will then determine by random procedure whether the escape is allowed.
	\item If the escape is allowed, the person must be released by the server administration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exception to Application-Based Interventions}\footnote{Law Enforcement Act dated May 27, 2024}
The server administration may not undertake application-based interventions in the projectโs internal environment if the application or the processing or approval process was faulty or irregular.

\section{Faction Rules}
\subsection{Factions}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item A faction is any group with at least one player.
	\item \textit{omitted}
	\item Factions are entitled to their own category in which they can set up any channels on request.
	\item The moderation can reject such requests if they cannot find a justified reason for setting them up.
	\item Due to the activities and tasks of the moderation, it is authorised to view the channels at any time in order to identify violations of the applicable law.
	\item Each faction is assigned its own role to ensure that these channels cannot be viewed by members of other factions.
    \item Participation in the server requires founding or joining a faction approved by the administration\footnote{para. 7-10, para. 15-20: Faction Establishment Act of 20 February 2024}.
    \item To establish a recognised faction, you must provide the following information to the Administration:
    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item The area of the faction
        \item The name of the state
        \item The insignia of the state
        \item All state members and their role-playing names
        \item The first leader of the state
    \end{enumerate}
	\item If an already recognised state loses one of the above criteria, it has two months to regain it.
    \item If the state does not manage to regain the criterion in time, it is officially dissolved.
	\item The server law does not establish succession rules and does not assess the legitimacy of a succession claim.\footnote{paras. 11-14: Faction Establishment Act Amendment of 26 February 2024}
	\item It is possible to change the government succession through internal events without the consent of the current head of state.
	\item Revolutionary wars are subject to martial law.
	\item Rebellious and revolting factions may choose as their initial faction territory any territory granted to them by the previous head of state. In this case, this territory is final.
    \item ${^1}$The territory and state insignia, as well as any other property and possessions of the state, are not protected by the server-wide guidelines and can therefore be claimed by other states. ${^2}$This does not apply for obligatory insignia.\footnote{Faction Establishment Act Amendment III of 27 June 2024}
    \item States may model themselves on any real state, but are not required to do so.
    \item It is not permitted to choose insignia or names that can be clearly assigned to a historical or current state without representing it.	
    \item Outside of a state of war recognised by server law and an area actively affected by a battle, you may not destroy foreign property or build on it without permission.\footnote{War Regulatory Act Amendment III of 17 June 2024} \footnote{Property Protection Act of 08 July 2024}
    \item Each state constitution is considered recognised as soon as it is publicly accessible and access has been enabled on the Discord server in the respective text channel.
    \item It is not possible to take legal action against state constitutions and agreements under server law, as long as they do not contradict server law.
    \item It is possible to challenge internal faction rulings under server law if they have no justifiable written basis.\footnote{Faction Establishment Act Amendment II of 24 March 2024}
	\item ${^1}$A state may not be attacked by other states until exactly two months after its foundation. ${^2}$As soon as the state attacks another state, this immunity lapses. ${^3}$Only newly founded states that have not emerged from any other state fall under this regulation.\footnote{Faction Establishment Act Amendment IV of 08 July 2024}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Faction insignia}\footnote{Faction Establishment Act vom 20. Februar 2024}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Any faction insignia must be unique and clearly distinguishable from the faction insignia of other factions.
    \item The faction insignia may not violate any rules of behaviour and must clearly serve the purpose of serious representation of the faction.
    \item Flags and insignia of real states are no exception to paragraph 2.
    \item The obligatory faction insignia include
    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item The flag of the faction
        \item The faction's coat of arms
        \item The uniforms of the faction
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Territorial expansion and martial law}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Territorial expansion must be recognised by the administration and requires either agreements between or mergers of states or a conquest of the state.
    \item The conquest of a state requires warfare that complies with the applicable server-wide laws of war.
    \item The server administration can decide on exceptions to martial law by unanimous vote. It is also up to the server administration to judge whether the rules requiring a subjective judgement have been violated. % Admins or legal department?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Begin of war}\footnote{War Regulatory Act vom 02. Juni 2023}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item \sent{1}A nation can only wage one war against another nation per month. \sent{2}This only applies to offensive and counterattack wars.
	\item Unoccupied states can be occupied by using the war points.
	\item You must publicly declare war on the state you wish to attack. % Deadline until actual war?
	\item When war is declared, neutral parties must be identified to observe the war and check that it conforms to the rules.
	\item If no appropriate neutral observers can be appointed, indirectly involved parties\footnote{for example, alliance parties} on the side of the attacker and on the side of the defender must withdraw from the war and act as observers.
	\item Observer decisions can be appealed to the server's legal department.\footnote{Sections 6-9: War Regulatory Act Amendment of 21 February 2024}
	\item Biased and manipulated observer decisions are against the rules.
	\item Once an observer has demonstrably not made a neutral judgement, he can no longer be appointed as an observer.
	\item An objection can be lodged against the election of observers.
	\item At the beginning, both parties must negotiate conditions that will apply at the end of the war if the defender wins. % Abolish?
	\item If the parties cannot reach an agreement within one week of the declaration of war, the defender may dictate the terms.
	\item The conditions must always be proportionate.
	\item If the defender has been absent without excuse from all negotiations within this week, the war begins without negotiations. In this case, the defender cannot claim any conditions.
	\item You may not take unoccupied lands during an ongoing war.
	\item You may occupy unoccupied territories at any time under server law without military action, provided you can prove a legitimate claim, as the territory belongs to the real state.
	\item When considering regions, cities and the like with regard to the law of war, the status of the beginning of the war is assumed.\footnote{From here on: War Regulatory Act Amendment II of 28 February 2024}
	\item Only boundaries that have been publicly announced apply.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{War Points}\footnote{War Regulatory Act of 02 June 2023}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item War points are a unit to determine how many wars can be fought by a state per month against unoccupied countries.\footnote{They are a method to prevent fighting huge countries as often as tiny countries.}
	\item \sent{1}Each month, a faction receives three war points. \sent{2}At the end of the month, the number of war points is not reset. % Adjustment of the number of war points?
	\item It is possible to capture only certain regions of an unoccupied territory. In this case, you only have to spend war points corresponding to the proportion of the total area.\footnote{War Regulatory Act Amendment II of 27 February 2024}
	\item If it is suspected that several sovereign states are sovereign mainly in order to receive more war points, the server administration must treat these sovereign states as a single faction for the purposes of war points and therefore only award the single war point number. % Question from the legal department?
	\item You have to wear the uniforms of your own nation in war.\footnote{War Regulatory Act Amendment IV of 27 June 2024}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Warfare}\footnote{War Regulatory Act of 02 June 2023}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item You can only attack countries that are directly adjacent to a passageway
	\item A passageway is a path that your troops can justifiably use through territories occupied by servers.
	\item A passageway is only considered to be justifiably usable if it is either part of your own territory or the territory of a state that demonstrably gives permission to cross it.
	\item \sent{1}You may also justifiably enter the territory of a state that you have declared war on. \sent{2}This only applies to occupied territories.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Occupation}\footnote{War Regulatory Act of 02 June 2023}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Any territory that could be successfully occupied with troops is considered occupied.
	\item If this territory was not defended, it is also considered occupied.
	\item An occupied territory is only considered occupied under server law if it has been recognised by the administration as legally acquired territory and awarded to the occupier.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Victory}\footnote{War Regulatory Act of 02 June 2023}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item You have won a region if you have conquered at least half of its cities, including its capital.
	\item If the aim of a war is not the conquest of an entire state, it is sufficient to capture the required regions.
	\item A state is conquered when at least two thirds of its regions and the capital have been captured. Depending on your national status, the capital is considered a separate region and must be included in the two thirds or not.
	\item A defensive war is won if the opponent was unable to hold or capture the occupied territories.
	\item An occupied zone is considered lost if it could not be captured or recaptured after the required and three additional battles.
	\item A required battle is any battle that directly fulfils your conditions.\footnote{For example, attacking a specific city within a region to capture it}
	\item Immediate victory also occurs if a state publicly announces its surrender.
	\item War cannot be waged in the absence of the soldiers of a state.
	\item More than half of all soldiers must be present.
	\item If no significant combat action has been taken by a state within two consecutive weeks for unexcused reasons or if its troops have been absent during this time, the state has lost if it is the defender.

	\item Exceeding the battlefield limits results in immediate elimination from the battle.
	\item Each battle must be recorded and monitored by an observer.

	\item Outposts do not need to be publicly labelled.
	\item The main outpost of a region is considered a city.
