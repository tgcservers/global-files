\section{Contractual Definitions}

\subsection{Contractual Validity}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item This agreement supersedes the provisions of the Agreement on the Implementation of a German-Korean Weapons Control Act with respect to Wisconsin.
    \item The following agreement shall remain valid until an agreement to annul this agreement is drafted and signed by all contracting parties.
    \item This agreement is subordinate to the national constitutions and jurisdictions.
    \item Decisions pursuant to this agreement must be approved by the majority of the contracting members.
    \item The designation of the states corresponds to their names at the time of initial signing.
    \item Only lawful successors of the states have the right to continue the membership of their predecessor in the agreement without signing.
    \item This also entails the full recognition of the entire content.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Lawful Successor}
A lawful successor is one who is recognized as such by the members of the Imperial Pact.

\subsection{Contractual Obligations of the Parties}
The parties undertake to incorporate the provisions of the agreement into their constitutions or otherwise fully valid legal texts of their nation in a manner consistent with the spirit of the agreement.

\section{Weapons Control Laws}
\subsection{Monopolies}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item The contracting parties assure that
    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item all firearms must be imported from the German Empire,
        \item all magical weapons must be imported from the Keosu Empire.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Citizens of the parties are not permitted to obtain these by other means.
    \item Weapons obtained otherwise, as well as the trade in such weapons, require the authorization of the party responsible for them.
    \item The weapons control laws include any additional accessories and materials that are used solely in connection with the respective weapons.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mandatory Sales}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item The parties must deliver weapons to the other party upon request.
    \item ${^1}$This obligation lapses if the concerned party refuses delivery, providing comprehensible and understandable reasons. ${^2}$This justifies a refund of the paid money.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Search Warrant}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Investigations regarding violations of the weapons control act on foreign territory require a search warrant.
    \item This warrant must be obtained by the International Criminal Court in a closed hearing with a reasonable and understandable presentation of urgent suspicion or the necessity of a preventive measure.
    \item ${^1}$The search warrant must be presented to the person whose territory is being searched upon entry. ${^2}$The task forces do not need to wait for the acknowledgment of the document by the concerned person to begin the investigation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Investigations}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item If there is suspicion of the illegal possession of goods falling under the provisions of this agreement by a citizen of the parties, or future illegal acquisition of such goods, this justifies a timely intervention by the party responsible for these weapons.
    \item A neutral party, which does not belong to the affected parties or the ruling house of Kazakhstan, must participate in operations and oversee compliance with the agreement.
    \item If no neutral party is present at the time of the operation, the operation must proceed without them.
    \item At the start of cooperation, task forces must escort affected persons to a safe area where they are not attacked by hostile entities.
    \item Task forces must treat individuals with respect, provided they clearly demonstrate willingness to cooperate.
    \item During this operation, task forces may shoot individuals who actively hinder the intervention.
    \item Furthermore, the order to shoot may be given if a person who does not belong to the task forces is equipped with a weapon.
    \item Task forces may take any necessary measures to secure illegal weapons.
    \item If a preventive measure is reported, any items that serve exclusively for the manufacture of weapons may also be confiscated.
    \item For any disturbances and emerging damages during the operation, task forces can only be held liable if these resulted from neglecting necessary caution, were clearly avoidable, and the task forces were demonstrably aware of the avoidability.
    \item Operations must be recorded in both video and audio.
    \item The destruction of operational recordings without the authorization of the other party, or their absence, constitutes a breach of contract.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Illegal Possession of Weapons}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item A person is guilty of illegal possession of weapons if they acquire, sell, or otherwise distribute weapons, materials, or accessories without the approval of the party responsible for these weapons, materials, or accessories.
    \item This will be punished with imprisonment of not less than one hour and a fine.
    \item Anyone who commercially sells or otherwise distributes weapons, materials, or accessories illegally must pay a fine and receive imprisonment of not less than four hours.
\end{enumerate}
