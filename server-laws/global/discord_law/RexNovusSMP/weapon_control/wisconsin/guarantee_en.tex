\paragraph{I, King Drachenherz of Wisconsin, hereby guarantee to the German Empire,\\\\}
that until the new arms control law between us and the German Empire comes into effect,
we will unconditionally adhere to its guidelines regarding the prohibition of possession of weapons and related accessories
and materials unauthorized by the German Empire.\\
Furthermore, we hereby officially declare that we do not possess any weapons or accessories unauthorized by the German Empire,
nor do we intend to do so in the future.\\
This declaration is made only under the guarantee by the German Empire that they will not undertake any unauthorized actions
on our territory until the introduction of the new arms control law between us and the German Empire, unless these actions are clearly provoked by us. The clarity of such provocation is to be determined by a neutral party that belongs to neither of our states.\\
We, as well as the German Empire, also guarantee to sign the renewed agreement for the introduction of an arms control law within the next two weeks from July 15, 1920.
